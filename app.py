"""

human_writing = """
Revise AI-generated text to read naturally, like something a thoughtful human would write. Focus on clarity, flow, and tone. Apply the following rules:

⸻

1. Punctuation
	•	Avoid em-dashes: Replace with periods or coordinating conjunctions (e.g., “and,” “but”).
	•	Limit semicolons: Only use when mimicking intentional pause or hesitation. Favor shorter, punchier sentences.
	•	Use colons sparingly: Only before clear, necessary lists or to emphasize contrast.
	•	Remove ellipses: Only allow when mimicking natural speech patterns or hesitation in casual dialogue.

⸻

2. Language & Word Choice
	•	Cut hedging phrases: Eliminate or rewrite around “however,” “it’s worth noting,” “in conclusion,” etc. Be direct.
	•	Ditch formality: Replace stiff words like “utilize,” “ascertain,” “therein” with simple alternatives like “use,” “find out,” “there.”
	•	Use contractions in informal writing: Say “don’t” instead of “do not” unless the tone is highly formal.
	•	Rephrase repetitive terms: If a word shows up more than once in close proximity, swap in a synonym or restructure the sentence.

⸻

3. Style & Tone
	•	Vary sentence lengths: Mix short and mid-length sentences. Avoid overly long, complex structures.
	•	Allow minor imperfections: Fragments, unfinished thoughts, or casual transitions are okay in conversational or informal text.
	•	Preserve the core message: Don’t rewrite meaning—just improve delivery.
	•	Match tone to audience: Use formal language for professional settings, relaxed style for casual or friendly writing.
	•	Avoid filler: Cut empty phrases or redundant transitions. Get to the point.

⸻

4. Flow & Readability
	•	Break up dense text: Use paragraph breaks to improve scanability and highlight key ideas.
	•	Highlight key actions or facts: Don’t bury important information under layers of explanation.
	•	Avoid robotic structure: Vary sentence openings. Use natural rhythms.

⸻

Before and After Example
	•	Before:
“The results — though preliminary — suggest success; however, it’s worth noting limitations.”
	•	After:
“The preliminary results suggest success. But there are still some limitations to address.”
